Work experience
======
* Jan 2022 - Present: Sr. Applied Scientist at AWS, Chime SDK    
    Amazon Chime SDK lets builders add real-time voice, video, and messaging powered by machine learning into their applications.
   * Built new ML based features for video conferencing such as face relighting and face touch-up / skin smoothing. Trained face segmentation model with limited dataset and designed novel post-processing algorithms for real-time inference.
   * Optimized models to run on edge devices such as laptops and mobiles.
   * Implemented algorithms for background blur, skin smoothing and look-up tables in WebGL to further reduce run-time in the browsers.
   * Conducted Mean Opinion Scoring studies to evaluate the model performance and to identify any biases.
