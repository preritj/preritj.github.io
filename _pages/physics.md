Academic experience
======
* *Aug 2014 - Aug 2017*: ***Postdoctoral Researcher*** at **Brown University**    
   * As an experienced postdoctoral researcher in the field of particle physics, I built theoretical models, performed data analysis using these models and applied machine learning to test these models in real world.
   * Built new physics search strategies using decision trees in C++ to classify collision events.
   * Calculated physics reach of new physics at future colliders using statistical analysis.

* *Aug 2012 - Aug 2014*: ***Postdoctoral Researcher*** at **Florida State University**    
   * Designed neural networks to classify different kinds of Higgs boson and calculated physics reach of future colliders using statistical analysis. 
   * Resolved a long standing anomaly in experiments at CERN by demonstrating that the numerical simulations were inconsistent with theoretical modeling.

* *Aug 2007 - Aug 2012*: ***Research Assistant*** at **Stony Brook University**    
   * Worked on topics ranging from Higgs physics, baryogenesis, collider physics, precision calculations for Large Hadron Collider and beyond Standard Model physics. 
   * Completed my PhD in theoretical physics from YITP, Stony Brook University.
