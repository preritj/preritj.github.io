I am a deep learning researcher and engineer interested in solving real-world problems using deep neural networks. Currently, I work at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) building Machine Learning powered features for video conferencing in the [Chime SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/).
