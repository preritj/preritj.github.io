I am a deep learning researcher and engineer interested in solving real-world problems using deep neural networks. Currently, I work at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) building Machine Learning (ML) powered features for video conferencing in the [Chime SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/). Previously, I have worked at a couple of startups in Bay Area. One of them was [DeepMap](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/hd-mapping/), now part of [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/), where I applied ML models for building High Definition maps for self-driving cars. Another one was [Standard AI](https://standard.ai/) where I built and applied ML models for autonomous retail stores i.e. cashierless checkout.
